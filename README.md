# AlgorithmVisualizer

I am creating this program to help teach myself data structures and algorithms, by provide a visual representation for certain sorting algorithms.
It is currently being developed as a Processing(Java-like syntax) application, however I plan on either porting it to a webpage or remaking it in another language in the future.
